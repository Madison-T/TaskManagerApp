# TaskManagerApp

A simple full-stack Task Manager built with **ASP.NET Core Web API** and a **vanilla JavaScript + HTML/CSS frontend**. 
I made this project to experiment with C# and .NET.

## ðŸ“¦ Features

- Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) tasks  
- RESTful API built with C# and Entity Framework Core  
- Responsive frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript  
- Connected to a relational database (supports Railway or Azure SQL)  
- Easily extendable to include authentication or filtering
